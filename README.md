# Webscraper: Zillow

### Purpose:
To scrape all the houses that are for sale on Zillow to detect commonalities between areas/ prices/ floor size etc. 

### Current Progress
The scraper is outdated. It has worked to a point where I could scrape the first page and create some Objects from them so I could do some test with a small amount of data. This project ended by getting sidetracked by trying to make a custom database using Pickle files, Hashes and Mapping (which ended up being pretty cool, but not better than what is availble today). 

### Future Features
* Updating so it works with the current new weblayout
* Tailor the scraper to Safari (Chrome has not been reliable)
* Multipage features: being able to scrape the whole website, not this the front page
* Hook up a DataBase instead of a CSV builder
* Start to make some sense out of the data
